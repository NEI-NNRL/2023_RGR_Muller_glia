This repository is associated with the manuscript "Rapid RGR-dependent visual pigment recycling is mediated by the RPE and specialized MÃ¼ller glia" by [Tworak, et al., 2023]().

### **Data**
scRNA-seq data was used for assessment of species-specific expression differences of RGR in Mueller glia cells.

#### *Mouse*
Mouse scRNA-seq data (Campello, Brooks, et al., manuscript in preparation) was obtained from NCBI's GEO database using accession GSE230049. The Seurat object of filtered and normalized data was used for analysis.

#### *Human*
Human fovea and peripheral retina scRNA-seq data was obtained from the Broad Single Cell Portal. Data was imported into a Seurat object for analysis.

#### *Macaque*
Macaque fovea and peripheral retina scRNA-seq data was obtained from the Broad Single Cell Portal. Data was imported into a Seurat object for analysis.
